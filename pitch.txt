fox is a browser-native AI agent that gives users one portable assistant across the web. Built as a Firefox extension with local voice input, it lets you say or type goals like "group my tabs by topic," "summarize the content across my open tabs," "open YouTube," and "search for videos related to the tabs I already have open," then executes them directly through browser tools instead of website-specific bots.
What makes fox different is execution governance. Every run shows an explicit mission timeline: what the agent plans, which tools it calls, and the result of each step. Capabilities are surfaced as permission tiers (read, navigate, close, interact). High-impact actions require confirmation before execution, commands can be interrupted mid-run with Cancel, and users can define blocked domains that fox will never inspect or interact with.
fox supports bring-your-own AI with OpenAI or local Ollama models, plus a wake-word voice pipeline (Silero VAD + Whisper) that works offline after setup. It operates with live browser context from your current tabs, URLs, titles, and extracted page signals, but within strict character and policy budgets so behavior stays predictable.
In short, fox demonstrates Mozilla’s core challenge: browser-level AI that is powerful enough to act across sites, but legible, permission-mediated, and user-controlled at every step.
